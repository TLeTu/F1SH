A fishing minigame where each time you caught a fish you have to play through a minigame to get that fish.
There will be 3 minigames:
1. A Reaction game where you have to click a button when it turn green.
2. A Click minigame where you have to click the mouse a given number of times in a given time period.
3. Another Reaction game, but this time you have to press the same arrow on you keyboard as the one that turned green on the screen.

You will have points, each game give you a number of points.
Base on the amount of points you have, the minigames will get harder.
When you fail a minigame you will get jumpscared, but it doesn't happen all the time, but the chance of it happenning will increase base on your points.
